\section{Background Literature}~\label{sec:literature}
Trajectories can be recorded at a variety of sampling speeds, are not noise-free, and the velocity between two successive positions is believed to be constant. A spatio temporal database is a list of trajectories. The size of a trajectory in a big database is known to be slightly smaller than the database's size.In microaggregation, the option of distance measure is crucial. It has an effect on how trajectories are grouped and, in most cases, on the anonymization method. A trajectory distance measure can be described by a variety of variables. A distance metric, for example, may only consider trajectories within a given timeframe, or it might look for spatial similarities regardless of direction or sampling rate, or it might take into account trajectory characteristics like speed and angle.\\
The Frechet distance, also known as the dog-leash distance, is based on the assumption that a human walks along one trajectory and his dog walks over the other. Both can fly at a positive yet independent pace. The Frechet distance determines the minimum length of leash allowed to walk the person's dog.
The shorter the leash, the tighter the two curves seem to be.
